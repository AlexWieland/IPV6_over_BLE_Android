# IPV6_over_BLE_Android
IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy on Android OS


Android application with support for IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy.
This version of the application has not been fully tested after some update in the code. (Subject to errors and to changes as part of improvement.)


This implementation is only a Proof of Concept, which doesn't fulfill the whole functionality, only a part of it to generate useful testdata. For simplicity, only the main functionality is included.


This software was one of the parts of the masterthesis "IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy on Android OS", which contains the references of this software.
Some of the References are the RFC7668, RFC6282, and RFC6775.
